# ToyNeuralNet
A toy neural network created by following tutorials from the coding train. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw 

During the summer of 2020 I was looking for an interesting side project to work on. I had limited knowledge of neural networks and how they work from university but i was keen to expand on this and began searching for tutorials online. 

I found 'The Coding Train' on YouTube and decided to follow some of his tutorials and began to develop my own Neural Network Library.

While much of the code is the same as the coding trains, the point of this exercise was to learn and understand how neural networks work.
